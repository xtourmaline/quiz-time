# Quiz Time

## Description

This is a timed quiz website on the fundamentals of JavaScript. This project was quite challenging for me as this is the first time I incorporated JavaScript to my website myself. However, I was able to use what I already knew about coding prior to build upon that. As a result, my understanding of JavaScript and how it can be used in websites increased.
